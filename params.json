Because I was tired of building (complex) forms by hand and needed\r\nsome lib for my projects that could handle the following:\r\n\r\n * Display a bunch of form elements in a (sometimes) complex grid\r\n * Have an \"edit\" and a \"view\" mode\r\n * Simple add validation or other event handler on form elements\r\n * Use the excellent bootstrap design and optional font awesome for \"nicer\" form ui\r\n * Have the ability to use elements spanning over some rows of the grid (rowspan and colspan)\r\n\r\nSince I did not find a library doing all that in a kindly manner: I did it myself :)\r\nThe code was done in three days in my sparetime, so I am sorry for all the mess and all the bugs that are still in there.\r\n\r\n## Example \r\n\r\nThis is how a form could look like.\r\nEXAMPLE IMAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nDownload the project and add the following files to your HTML page or start with the **test.html** from the source.\r\nOf course you can use all the third party stuff from CDNs, if you like.\r\nIf you want that, then you probably know what to do by yourself :)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Design stuff -->\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/reset.css\"><!-- optional: for reseting browser defaults -->\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/bootstrap.min.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/jquery.gridform.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/font-awesome.css\"><!-- optional: for nicer checboxes and stuff -->\r\n<!-- JS-Libs (best to include at the END ofr your HTML file !!-->\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery.gridform.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to the excellent work of \r\n * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n * [Bootstrap twitter](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n * [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
